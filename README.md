# InteractiveAirPollutionDecisionTree

These are the resources used for the talk and interactive game given on 24th May 2023 for the Pint Of Science talk in Exeter. 

Feel free to use them if you wish, simply download the decision tree cards file and print them out! Some cutting and laminating required! 

The instructions for the game can be found in the PoS presentation file.
